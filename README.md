# FlyClassificationWithLocomotion

This repository is used to report the research result of applying machine learning to predict fly's genotypes using their locomotion data.

## To replicate the model training  
--> TutorialForTrainingModel-With-LocomotionData.ipynb  
--> Trajectories folder stores locomotion data

## To replicate data analyze  
--> Use DataAnalyze folder

## To view the research result  
--> Reports folder contains the result of model accuracy and data analyze in ppt files
